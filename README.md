# Chinook-database-using-SQL
In this project, I queried the Chinook Database. 
The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. 
For this project, I will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store 
their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 
To assist in the queries ahead, 
the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.
i then wrote a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer my question.
Used the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers my question.
all queryies are availble in the files uploaded.
my  presentation includes:

Four slides
One visualization per slide
A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
The SQL query used to create the data used in the visualization.
